## Rename the AWS resources from `catabasis` to `incatalog`

The code and docs use `incatalog`, but the deployed AWS resources still carry the old
working name. These three must change together, as a planned migration:

- **`var.name` default** in `infra/terraform/variables.tf`. Every resource is named from
  it (ECR repo, both Lambdas and their log groups, the S3 data and site buckets, CloudFront,
  the EventBridge rule, API Gateway). Changing it makes `terraform apply` destroy and
  recreate them, so copy the data and site buckets' contents and push the image to the new
  ECR repo first (or `terraform state mv` / import where a resource can keep its identity).
- **The state bucket** `catabasis-tfstate-<account>` and key `catabasis/terraform.tfstate`
  in `infra/terraform/backend.hcl` and `infra/state-bucket.sh`. S3 buckets can't be
  renamed: create the new bucket, update both files, run
  `terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl -migrate-state`, then delete the old bucket.
- **The `catabasis-*` ARNs** in `infra/deploy-policy.json`. Update the policy in IAM
  wherever it is attached, before the first deploy under the new names, or deploys lose
  permission.
